# MERN CRUD app

## Testing the waters with the MERN stack.

In this simple competitor registration app for a running event I implemented four basic functions, create, read, update and delete (CRUD). There are many more functions I would have liked to add to the app if time allowed. I look forward to work more with mongodb in future projects and try things like the $addToSet operator and more.

## Deployment

The app was deployed with Heroku and Surge

[Live version](runningcompetitionregistration.surge.sh)
