# MERN CRUD app

Testing the waters with the MERN stack. In this simple runner registration app I implemented four basic functions, create, read, update and delete (CRUD). There are many more things I would have liked to add to the app if time allowed. I look forward to work more with mongodb in future projects and try things like the $addToSet operator etc.
